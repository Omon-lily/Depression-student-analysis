## Overview
This project analyzes depression among students based on various factors, such as academic pressure, financial stress, sleep duration, dietary habits, and gender differences. The analysis is conducted using Excel, utilizing data visualization tools like bar charts, pie charts, and summary statistics to present key insights.

## Key Findings
1Ô∏è‚É£ Depression by Academic Pressure
Depression levels vary with academic pressure, affecting both male and female students.

A higher number of students experiencing moderate to high academic pressure report symptoms of depression.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Depression by Sleep Duration
Students sleeping less than 5 hours or more than 8 hours tend to show a higher prevalence of depression.

Sleep patterns play a crucial role in mental health, with irregular sleep schedules contributing to depressive symptoms.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Depression by Gender
Out of 502 students, 138 males and 114 females reported experiencing depression.

Depression rates appear to be almost equal among genders, suggesting that both male and female students are significantly impacted.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Depression by Financial Stress
Financial stress is a key contributing factor to depression:

54.15% of female students and 45.85% of male students report financial stress-related depression.

This suggests a possible link between economic challenges and mental health among students.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Depression by Dietary Habits
Students with moderate dietary habits show notable signs of depression.

Analyzing the impact of healthy vs. unhealthy eating habits on mental health could provide further insights.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Suicidal Thoughts
The analysis indicates that 260 students reported suicidal thoughts.

A higher number of male students seem to experience these thoughts compared to female students.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Depression by Age
Depression is prevalent across all age groups, with the highest cases seen in the 23-27 and 28-32 age ranges.

The 18-22 and 33-37 age groups show slightly lower depression levels, but it remains a concern across all demographics.
